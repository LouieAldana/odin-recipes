    <p>Lasagna is a classic Italian dish made with layers of wide, flat pasta sheets alternating with fillings like meat sauce (ragù), béchamel sauce, and various cheeses, all baked together and then sliced into squares to serve; essentially, it's a layered pasta casserole with rich, savory flavors originating from Italy. 
    </p>

    <p>Lasagna is a wide, flat sheet of pasta. Lasagna can refer to either the type of noodle or to the typical lasagna dish which is a dish made with several layers of lasagna sheets with sauce and other ingredients, such as meats and cheese, in between the lasagna noodles.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Ground beef, ground turkey, or Italian sausage</li>
        <li>Pancetta or bacon</li>
        <li>Tomato sauce, made with crushed tomatoes and tomato paste</li>
        <li>Meat ragù</li>
        <li>Bechamel sauce</li>
        <li>Eggs, to bind the ricotta mixture and add moisture</li>
        <li>Onion and garlic, for flavor</li>
        <li>Italian seasoning</li>
        <li>Dried parsley, salt, and black pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Make the Italian sausage.</strong> Sauté onions in olive oil over medium heat in a large skillet until just soft, 3-4 minutes. Add garlic and stir for a minute. Add ground beef, pork, salt, pepper, oregano, sage, fennel seed, smoked paprika, and red pepper flakes (if using). Cook for 7-8 minutes, stirring, until the meat browns.</li>

        <li><strong>Prepare the meat sauce.</strong> Add 3 cups of the marinara sauce and the broth into the skillet with the seasoned meat. Cover, bring to a simmer for 5 minutes, then turn off the heat. You’ll have roughly 4 ½ cups of tomato meat sauce. Tip: Taste; if it tastes acidic, add 1-2 teaspoons of sugar or honey to taste.
        </li>

        <li><strong>Mix the cheese filling.</strong> Mix the ricotta, egg, salt, nutmeg, and pepper in a medium bowl. Add 1 1/2 cups grated mozzarella and 1/2 cup grated parmesan and stir. (Save the remaining 1/4 cup parmesan and 1 cup mozzarella for the top.)</li>

        <li><strong>Assemble the lasagna.</strong> Spread one cup of the reserved marina sauce on the bottom of a greased 9 x 13 pan or casserole dish. Place 3 lasagna noodles on top of the sauce. Spread a third of the ricotta cheese mixture evenly on the noodles, then cover with a third (1 ½ cups )of the meat sauce. Repeat this layering sequence 2 more times.</li>

        <li><strong>For the top layer: </strong> Place the final layer of lasagna noodles on top and cover with the remaining reserved marinara. Sprinkle with reserved parmesan, and then mozzarella last!</li>

        <li><strong>Bake.</strong> Cover the pan with a layer of parchment paper and foil so the foil doesn't touch the lasagna. Bake on the middle rack for 45 minutes until it is bubbling. Uncover and bake 15 minutes until golden. Optional: Broil for a few minutes until cheese is bubbly and browned.</li>

        <li><strong>Cool.</strong> Let lasagna cool for 20 minutes before slicing and serving. Garnish with chopped fresh chopped herbs like parsley, basil, thyme or oregano.</li>
    </ol>
